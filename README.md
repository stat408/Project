## Project Overview

STAT 408 has a course project worth 20% of the final grade. The project will be completed individually or as a group of two using a dataset of the student's choosing to create a Shiny dashboard / app.


### Evaluation
A full rubric will be provided later, but the evaluation will be based on:

- Intermediate Dashboard Submission: 10%
- Oral App Demonstration: 30%
- Shiny Dashboard Features and Functionality: 50%
- Peer Feedback: 10%

### Checkpoints

- September 17: Choose dataset & preliminary data visualization
- November 5: Intermediate Dashboard Submission
- November 12: Intermediate Submission Feedback Due
- November 19 & 21th: In class App Demonstrations
- November 25: Dashboard Submission


### Intermediate Dashboard Submission
Students will submit a functional app and source code for peer review. 

#### Peer Feedback
Throughout the course of the project you will be asked to evaluate classmates coding and presentation. Thoughtful, and respectful, comments will be expected as part of this component.

#### In class App Demonstrations
Demonstrations of the Shiny app will occur the week of November 17 and November 19. Each student will introduce the dataset and research questions they were hoping to address. Then the features and functionality of the app will be displayed.
