The data storytelling project is worth 20 percent of the course grade. 

The motivation for this assignment is the famous, at least in statistical circles, Hans Rosling. The late Rosling’s Ted Talk titled “The best stats you’ve ever seen,” ([YouTube link](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen)) has been viewed over 14 million times. Furthermore, Rosling’s video titled “200 countries, 200 years, 4 minutes,” which has over 9 million views, does a masterful job of distilling raw data into an entertaining and informative four minute video. 

In statistics and the data science fields, employers are starting to look for digital portfolios that contain evidence of computer code as well as data visualization and analysis. Success on this assignment will be a professional, data storytelling video that will serve as the capstone for this course and that students can share with future employers. 

For this assignment, create a short video (between 4 and 5 minutes) to motivate
